"KNN_Classifier.py" train and test the KNN classifier, save and output the KNN model "knn_model.sav"
"finalProject_OnsetDetector.py" implement the onset detection algorithm
"evaluation.py" combined onset detector with the KNN model. Evaluate the onset with ground truth, and drum prediction with ground truth
"runModel.py" inputs a drum audio, outputs the onset time and the drum prediction

# Folder description:
"MDLib2.2" is the drum one-shots datasets
